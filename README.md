# ParallerOpenMPPiCount

By using C++ programming language and OpenMP C/C++ compiler's extension create a console application able to calculate value of PI number in parallel. The calculation can be done in accordance to the following equation:

vypočet pi

The application's user must be allowed to specify:

    calculation precision by setting of N value (the value should be higher than 1000)
    number of CPU cores engaged in the calculation


Hint:

    use appropriate built-in OpenMP directives and clauses instead of manual coding of desired functionality
    focus to usage of reduction data clause
