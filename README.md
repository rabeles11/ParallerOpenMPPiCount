The application's user must be allowed to specify:

    calculation precision by setting of N value (the value should be higher than 1000)
    number of CPU cores engaged in the calculation


Hint:

    use appropriate built-in OpenMP directives and clauses instead of manual coding of desired functionality
    focus to usage of reduction data clause
